List of datasets with their download link:

� NSL-KDD
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hassan06/nslkdd

� LYCOS-IDS2017
http://maupiti.univ-lemans.fr:2443/lycos/lycos-ids2017/src/65b9f2fea8195b8c5220ae1a4191d03ea65619bb (you must build the dataset starting from CIC-IDS2017, using the repo instructions and scripts)

� CIC-IDS2017
https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html

� UNSW-NB15
https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset

� CSE-CIC-IDS2018
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solarmainframe/ids-intrusion-csv?select=02-14-2018.csv (not the original dataset, it would be 220 GB otherwise; invalid rows (the ones with the header among the data) were removed directly from the csv files; not the full dataset, sampling was performed keeping 100k rows for each csv and the original attacks distribution; I couldn't include 02-20-2018.csv due to its size)

� (NOT USED) IoT-NID
https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/iot-network-intrusion-dataset but I didn't download it, because labeling is not provided in the pcap files + no sampling was found ---> we ignore this dataset

� (EDA WAS DONE, BUT NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE) CIDDS-001
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhoogla/cidds001?select=cidds-001-openstack.parquet (not the full dataset, it would be huge), EDA was performed but the dataset is very very unbalanced!
